		<p>I'm Stephanie Paulantis, this is my website.</p>
		<p> 
			I'm an artist, maker, and crafter. 
			I draw & paint, do fiber arts, dink around with circuit boards and LEDs, 
			and generally experiment with projects at the intersections of my many interests. This is where I attempt to collect and 
			showcase the things I've made over the years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because I have a lot of varied interests and hobbies, my work spans multiple mediums and genres.
			I've roughly grouped some things together into categories in an attempt to present cohesive collections of works. Some pieces will be found in multiple categories.
			Some pieces probably should be in multiple categories, but I've left them in the one spot I think they fit best.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of making things, I work in higher ed as a web developer. I enjoy video games (retro games especially), reading, speed puzzling, disc golf, attending festivals,
			and spending time with my partner and our many pets.
		</p>

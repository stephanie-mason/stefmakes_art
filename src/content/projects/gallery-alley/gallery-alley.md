I painted this door for [Downtown Bellingham Partnership's Gallery Alley](https://www.downtownbellingham.com/public-art). It will be [on auction until September 30, 2025](https://givebutter.com/c/Osqh98/auction/items/1140447), with proceeds going to DBP.

In this project, I used a [doodle grid](https://youtu.be/7uDypeqS0hQ?si=b_E8vFWqP5yzybJe) for the first time to enlarge my reference sketch. I also learned that you should NOT do this with alcohol markers! The paint covered the markers fine, but when I applied a clear protective coating, they suddenly leaked through the paint and it looked as if I had doodled right on top ðŸ˜¥ The good news is that because the door was intended to be displayed outside, I used a lightfast [mural paint](https://chromaonline.com/mural-paint/). Alcohol markers are notoriously not lightfast, so some time out in the sun has faded the ink quite a lot. I expect the marks will continue to fade throughout the duration of the door's display.

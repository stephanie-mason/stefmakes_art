Hanging LED sculpture made for my festival camp. The wire base was sculpted by my talented partner. A variety of lace making techniques (needle lace, knitting, and crochet) were used for the surface treatment, and leds arranged inside. 

There are six different animation patterns with different color stories, and it switches off every 10 minutes between them. It's also programmed to scale it's brightness up or down depending on the ambient light (based on an internal clock, not an actual light sensor.) So in the twighlight hours when there is still ambient light, it goes to full brightness. When it's dark out, it lowers in brightness so that it's not completely blinding.

After I made the [Red Leaf Fabric](/projects/red-leaf-fabric/red-leaf-fabric/), which I turned into a pair of modern short stays for my sisters, I set out to make myself a matching pair in green. I ended up changing too many variables on my second go around, and created some fabric that wasn't in line with my original vision. Too dark, not well defined enough leaves. So I tried again and go exactly what I wanted. I sandwiched the two together for a pair of my own reversible short stays, which I have yet to wear first-try-side-out.

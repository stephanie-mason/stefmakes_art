In the first half of 2019, my sisters and our BFF all made historically accurate Elizabethan era costumes to wear to a local ren faire (and have for a variety of costumed occasions, which we frequent.) We all did some degree of hand sewing, and I completed my costume with 100% hand sewing. Probably wouldn't do it that way again, but I really enjoyed the experience! 

Nearly everything from my costume was created using[Elizabethan Costuming Page](http://elizabethancostume.net/#patterns) as a resource, with some references to [The Tudor Tailor](https://www.tudortailor.com/the-tudor-tailor). I also made my husband a shirt and hose using the patterns in the book.

My costume consisted of a reversible bodice, skirt, stays, petticoat, smock, partlet, cap, and bum roll. My husband also made me some shoes, which aren't visible in the photos. The nice thing about having so many costume pieces is that this dress has proven very easy to style for different events, as either gray/red/a mix. I have also used the individual pieces in other more fantasy based costumes, and lent out pieces to other folks for ensemble looks. All in all a very useful and reusable costume!

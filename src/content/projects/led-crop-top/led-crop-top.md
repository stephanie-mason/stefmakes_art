One of my more ambitious early projects. I hand soldered the flexible LED array. Due to budget (and available material) constraints at the time, I used leds that didn't even have a PCB backing! This seems utterly wacky to me now but was a good learning experience I guess. The smocking is also hand stitched. Great little project that held up surprisingly well. I've always wanted to do more with the fabric texture-over-leds thing.

In 2015, I found some really neat printed festival tents that were very out of my starving student budget. So I decided to make my own ğŸ’… The first year I used it it just had the Pithue painted on the side, and a few years later I got around to adding the swirls. It's a fun little tent. The bird even glows in the dark, which is pretty hilarious when you're laying inside at night and passers-by are discovering that fact and shining their flash lights on it!

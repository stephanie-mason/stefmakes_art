After I made the [Neon Rave Onesie](/projects/neon-rave-onesie/neon-rave-onesie), I had some leftover yarn and wanted to make another item that my sister/other friends could wear to match (or just to wear when I'm not in the mood for a full onesie situation.) So I made this vest for my siter to wear to Summer Meltdown. I then made some pants for my husband out of a different colorway.

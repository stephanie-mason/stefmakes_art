A project that combines many different art practices of mine. The base layer is a bargello quilt top. The faun was painted on cotton fabric with acrylics, then cut out and appiqued to the quilt top, and the whole thing was quilted to batting. The flowers were made with a combination of sewing and crochet techniques. I placed individaul RGB leds at the flower centers, and then placed some LED strip lighting behind the quilt and wired everything to a QTPy chip with customized animations.

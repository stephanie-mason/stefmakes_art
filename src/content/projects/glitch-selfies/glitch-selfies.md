Between 2016-2019, I enjoyed creating these glitch art pieces. They were fairly quick and easy to make, easy to post, and were a nice way to stay creatively active while back in school. Most of them were self portraits, although I sometimes branched out with other subjects. While I don't make this type of art anymore, it still influences a lot of my more recent work, and I use some of the same techniques for creating the digital sketches for my traditional pieces.

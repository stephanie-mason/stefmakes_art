When I went back to school from 2015-2017, I didn't have a lot of extra time for my usual sewing/knitting type projects. My main creative outlet for this time was makeup (which I could do in a set amount of time in the morning) and nail art (which I could do while studying, since there was a lot of waiting for polish to dry). I did a lot of every day makeup, but for special events or if I was just feeeling extra creative I'd do more artsy makeup. These were some of my favorite looks.

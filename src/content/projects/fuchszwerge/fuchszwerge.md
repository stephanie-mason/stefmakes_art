This year I have been reading Heather Fawcett's Emily Wilde series. After reading *Map of the Otherlands*, I was very taken by the *fuchszwerge* and their description as looking very much like foxes, but with the faces of human infants. I aged the features of my foxes up a bit, but all credit for the inspiration goes to the author.

# To Future Stephanie

## Run Locally
npm run dev

## Git
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/.ssh/stef_id -o IdentitiesOnly=yes' git push -u origin main


## Note
Video & Uploads folders ignored, as videos have been uploaded to hosting platform. If ever this moves to github pages, another solution for videos (either compressing/trimming or externally hosting) will need to be explored, otherwise the repo is too big
